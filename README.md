# Simulation Project (DS331)

## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the **DS331 Simulation Project**! This project features two exciting and practical simulations designed to demonstrate the power of systems modeling in real-world applications. Dive into two different worlds:

1. **Petrol Station Multi-Channel Queue Simulation** ⛽
   - Simulate the dynamics of a busy petrol station with multiple pumps catering to different fuel types. Track wait times, service times, and optimize pump usage to ensure smooth operations.

2. **Hospital Inventory System Simulation** 🏥
   - Explore an inventory management system designed for hospitals. Simulate the tracking and restocking of medical supplies, optimize inventory levels, and prevent shortages in critical situations.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Multichannel Queueing System**: Simulates customer interactions at a petrol station, modeling wait times, queues, and service efficiency.
- **Hospital Inventory Management**: Models the flow of medical supplies within a hospital, ensuring optimal inventory levels are maintained to prevent shortages.
- **GUI Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface built with Python’s Tkinter library, allowing users to select and run simulations with a click.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Dive deep into the problem analysis, experimental results, and conclusions in the `docs.pdf` file.

## 📊 Simulation Goals

### Petrol Station Simulation
- **Objective**: Simulate a petrol station with three pumps and categorize cars based on fuel type needs.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Average service times
  - Queue lengths
  - Pump idle times
  - Optimization of pump allocation

### Hospital Inventory System
- **Objective**: Simulate the inventory system of a hospital to track supplies across different floors and prevent stockouts.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Average units in stock
  - Shortage frequency
  - Optimization of inventory review periods and lead times

## 🛠️ Requirements
